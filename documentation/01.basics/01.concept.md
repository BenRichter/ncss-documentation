NCSS is a naming convention for semantic CSS. Get rid of reading your HTML again and again to find out what elements, tags and sections are affected.


Problem
-------

Massive CSS on **larger projects** used to cause issues:

- Teamwork without uniform conventions
- Missing context to the project's layout and structure
- Big ball of mud instead of modularization
- Lack of inline documentation
- No possibility for automated validation


Conclusion
----------

The goal of **NCSS** is to provide **semantic information** while reading CSS:

- What kind of elements, tags and sections are affected
- What is the relation and inheritance of one class to another
- Where is the most accurate place to add new declarations
