Named Cascading Style Sheets is a naming convention and guideline for semantic `CSS`.


Why
---

Massive `CSS` used to be a nightmare while working on projects with different kind of developers. The lack of conventions and guidelines are going to lead to a unmaintainable ball of mud.


Goal
----

Get rid of reading your `HTML` again and again to find out:

- What kind of tags, components and sections are affected
- What is the relation and inheritance of one class to another
- Where is the most accurate place to add declarations
